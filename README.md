# movie-lister

I have deployed the server folder on heroku and client folder on netlify

https://movielistsjs.herokuapp.com/

https://movie-lister-js.netlify.app/login

However due to some error a 404 not found is happening

My github repository is this :
https://github.com/XEclipse-create/movie-lister

If you could please clone the repository. I have added all features. The deployment has gone a bit wrong due to time

You can clone the repository using:

git clone https://github.com/XEclipse-create/movie-lister.git
